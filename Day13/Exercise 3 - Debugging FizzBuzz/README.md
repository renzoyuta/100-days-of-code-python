## FizzBuzz
- Your program should print each number from 1 to x where x is the input number. 
- However when the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".   
- When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz". 
- And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz".
